Here's an example of we could implement a simple hybrid movement model for a species like deer in Otway's National Forest using Python:

First, we need to define the different habitats in the forest and their resource availability using a GIS package like GDAL or PyQGIS. For instance, we could create a raster file where each pixel represents a habitat type (e.g., forest, grassland, wetland), and the pixel value indicates the resource availability in that habitat (e.g., high, medium, low).

```python
import gdal
import numpy as np

# Open the raster file that contains habitat data
habitat_file = "habitat.tif"
habitat_ds = gdal.Open(habitat_file)

# Get the habitat data as a numpy array
habitat_data = np.array(habitat_ds.GetRasterBand(1).ReadAsArray())

# Define a dictionary that maps pixel values to resource availability levels
resource_levels = {1: "low", 2: "medium", 3: "high"}
```

Next, we can define the behavior of deer using a simple prey-predator model, where deer move towards habitats with high resource availability while avoiding habitats where predators are present. For this example, we'll assume that the predators are modeled as random noise in the habitat data, where values above a certain threshold indicate the presence of a predator.

```python
# Define a function that returns the movement direction for a deer based on its current location
def get_deer_movement_direction(deer_location):
    # Get the resource availability level of the deer's current habitat
    habitat_resource_level = resource_levels.get(habitat_data[deer_location[0], deer_location[1]], "unknown")
    
    # Determine the movement direction based on the deer's behavior
    if habitat_resource_level == "high":
        # Move towards habitats with high resource availability
        return np.array([1, 0])
    else:
        # Move randomly while avoiding habitats with predators
        predator_threshold = 2  # adjust this value based on the habitat data
        while True:
            new_direction = np.random.randint(-1, 2, size=2)
            new_location = deer_location + new_direction
            if habitat_data[new_location[0], new_location[1]] < predator_threshold:
                return new_direction
```

Finally, we can simulate the movement of deer in the forest over time using a simple loop. For this example, we'll assume that there are 100 deer in the forest, and we'll simulate their movement for 100 time steps.

```python
# Initialize the deer locations randomly
num_deer = 100
deer_locations = np.random.randint(0, habitat_data.shape, size=(num_deer, 2))

# Simulate the movement of the deer over time
num_steps = 100
for t in range(num_steps):
    for i in range(num_deer):
        # Get the movement direction for the current deer
        direction = get_deer_movement_direction(deer_locations[i])
        
        # Update the deer's location based on the movement direction
        new_location = deer_locations[i] + direction
        
        # Make sure the deer stays within the forest boundaries
        new_location = np.clip(new_location, 0, habitat_data.shape - 1)
        
        # Update the deer's location
        deer_locations[i] = new_location
```

This is a simple example of how you could implement a hybrid movement model for a species like deer in Otway's National Forest using Python. Of course, we could make this model more complex by incorporating additional factors such as weather conditions, habitat fragmentation, and inter-species interactions.


Here's an example of what the .tif file might look like for the habitat data, using the GDAL library:

```
Driver: GTiff/GeoTIFF
Files: habitat.tif
Size is 100, 100
Coordinate System is `'
Origin = (0.000000000000000,100.000000000000000)
Pixel Size = (1.000000000000000,-1.000000000000000)

    STATISTICS_MEAN=1.6983

    STATISTICS_STDDEV=0.82934776186649
```

In this example, the habitat data is represented as a grayscale raster image in GeoTIFF format, with a resolution of 100 x 100 pixels. Each pixel value represents the resource availability in that habitat, with values ranging from 0 (low) to 3 (high).

To determine the speed at which the deer move, we can define a parameter that represents the distance the deer can move in one time step, based on the scale of your simulation. For example, if your simulation represents each pixel in the habitat map as 1 meter, you could set the speed parameter to 10 meters per time step to simulate a deer that moves at an average speed of 10 meters per second. We can adjust this value based on the behavior of the deer species you are simulating, as well as other factors such as the terrain and the presence of obstacles.
